(Program to print first 11 fibonacci numbers)
(Author : Suloch)

Put nothing into my words
my promises were lies
my truth was too
Put my promises without my truth into my life
Put my life into my promises
the thought was benevolent
Whisper my promises
Until the thought is higher than nothing
Whisper my promises
Put my life into my words
Put my promises into my life
Put my life with my words into my promises
Knock the thought down
